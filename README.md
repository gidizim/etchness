The process of looking for a job is extremely time-consuming with users forced to frequently
check a wide variety of websites in order to stay up-to-date on all available jobs. There is
also currently no convenient way of accessing personalised industry news in one place so
that users can be knowledgeable about any recent changes or innovations in their interested
industries. Additionally, it is difficult to keep track of jobs that are specific to an individual's
needs and interests from a variety of job hubs as well as all their application statuses.
Our web application, Job-Hunta, takes popular job search APIs such as CareerJet, Adzuna,
and GitHub Jobs, and combines them into one integrated job hub for our user's
convenience, whilst offering a multitude of quality features.
